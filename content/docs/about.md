## Why is Phaser awesome?

Wait, which one? this one or the one on Star Trek?

Assuming you mean this one, besides using Lo-Dash as the template engine, Phaser also:

* Comes complete with more than 50 tags and filters,
* Offeres dozens of helpful utilites,
* Multiple ways to do includes
* Markdown table of contents (even multi-file with relative links!)
* Comment parsing
* YAML front matter
* Plugins
* Mixins
* So much more. Much much more. So much more that you don't even know how much more, it's so much. I don't know where to start.

## Wait. What? I thought Assemble did this?!

Use Phaser to generate markdown, use Assemble to build HTML. Of course, Assemble could be used for both, but Phaser is the right tool for this job, since it was specifically created to make GitHub projects and documentation easier to manage.
